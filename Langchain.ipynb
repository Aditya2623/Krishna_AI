Therein stand ranked\\nChiefs like Arjuna, like to Bhima chiefs,\\nBenders of bows; Virata, Yuyudhan,\\nDrupada, eminent upon his car,\\nDhrishtaket, Chekitan, Kasi\\'s stout lord,\\nPurujit, Kuntibhoj, and Saivya,\\nWith Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauj\\nSubhadra\\'s child; and Drupadi\\'s;-all famed!\\nAll mounted on their shining chariots!\\nOn our side, too,--thou best of Brahmans! see\\nExcellent chiefs, commanders of my line,\\nWhose names I joy to count: thyself the first,\\nThen Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight,\\nVikarna, Aswatthaman; next to these\\nStrong Saumadatti, with full many more\\nValiant and tried, ready this day to die\\nFor me their king, each with his weapon grasped,\\nEach skilful in the field. Weakest-meseems-\\nOur battle shows where Bhishma holds command,\\nAnd Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!\\nHave care our captains nigh to Bhishma\\'s ranks\\nPrepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!\"\\n\\nThen, at the signal of the aged king,\\nWith blare to wake the blood, rolling around\\nLike to a lion\\'s roar, the trumpeter\\nBlew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it,\\nTrumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns\\nBurst into sudden clamour; as the blasts\\nOf loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed!\\nThen might be seen, upon their car of gold\\nYoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,\\nKrishna the God, Arjuna at his side:\\nKrishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch\\nCarved of the \"Giant\\'s bone;\" Arjuna blew\\nIndra\\'s loud gift; Bhima the terrible--\\nWolf-bellied Bhima-blew a long reed-conch;\\nAnd Yudhisthira, Kunti\\'s blameless son,\\nWinded a mighty shell, \"Victory\\'s Voice;\"\\nAnd Nakula blew shrill upon his conch\\nNamed the \"Sweet-sounding,\" Sahadev on his\\nCalled\"Gem-bedecked,\" and Kasi\\'s Prince on his.\\nSikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn,\\nVirata, Satyaki the Unsubdued,\\nDrupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!)\\nLong-armed Subhadra\\'s children, all blew loud,\\nSo that the clangour shook their foemen\\'s hearts,\\nWith quaking earth and thundering heav\\'n.\\n\\nThen \\'twas-\\nBeholding Dhritirashtra\\'s battle set,\\nWeapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war\\nInstant to break-Arjun, whose ensign-badge\\nWas Hanuman the monkey, spake this thing\\nTo Krishna the Divine, his charioteer:\\n\"Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground\\nBetwixt the armies; I would see more nigh\\nThese who will fight with us, those we must slay\\nTo-day, in war\\'s arbitrament; for, sure,\\nOn bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain,\\nObeying Dhritirashtra\\'s sinful son.\"\\n\\nThus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!)\\nBetween the hosts that heavenly Charioteer\\nDrove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds\\nWhere Bhishma led,and Drona,and their Lords.\\n\"See!\" spake he to Arjuna, \"where they stand,\\nThy kindred of the Kurus:\" and the Prince\\nMarked on each hand the kinsmen of his house,\\nGrandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons,\\nCousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed\\nWith friends and honoured elders; some this side,\\nSome that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed,\\nSuch kith grown enemies-Arjuna\\'s heart\\nMelted with pity, while he uttered this:\\n\\nArjuna.\\nKrishna! as I behold, come here to shed\\nTheir common blood, yon concourse of our kin,\\nMy members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth,\\nA shudder thrills my body, and my hair\\nBristles with horror; from my weak hand slips\\nGandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns\\nMy skin to parching; hardly may I stand;\\nThe life within me seems to swim and faint;\\nNothing do I foresee save woe and wail!\\nIt is not good, O Keshav! nought of good\\nCan spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate\\nTriumph and domination, wealth and ease,\\nThus sadly won! Aho! what victory\\nCan bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils\\nCould profit; what rule recompense; what span\\nOf life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood?\\nSeeing that these stand here, ready to die,\\nFor whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased,\\nAnd power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons,\\nBrothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law,\\nElders and friends! Shall I deal death on these\\nEven though they seek to slay us? Not one blow,\\nO Madhusudan! will I strike to gain\\n\\nThe rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less\\nTo seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these\\nMust breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be\\nGuilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths;\\nTheir sins will light on us, if we shall slay\\nThose sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;\\nWhat peace could come of that, O Madhava?\\nFor if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,\\nThese cannot see, or will not see, the sin\\nOf kingly lines o\\'erthrown and kinsmen slain,\\nHow should not we, who see, shun such a crime--\\nWe who perceive the guilt and feel the shame--\\nO thou Delight of Men, Janardana?\\nBy overthrow of houses perisheth\\nTheir sweet continuous household piety,\\nAnd-rites neglected, piety extinct--\\nEnters impiety upon that home;\\nIts women grow unwomaned, whence there spring\\nMad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,\\nSending a Hell-ward road that family,\\nAnd whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.\\nNay, and the souls of honoured ancestors\\nFall from their place of peace, being bereft\\nOf funeral-cakes and the wan death-water.[FN#1]\\nSo teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay\\nKinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,\\nAhovat! what an evil fault it were!\\nBetter I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,\\nTo face them weaponless, and bare my breast\\nTo shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.\\n\\nSo speaking, in the face of those two hosts,\\nArjuna sank upon his chariot-seat,\\nAnd let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.\\n\\nHERE ENDETH  I. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,\\nEntitled \"Arjun-Vishad,\"\\nOr \"The Book of the Distress of Arjuna.\"\\n\\n II\\n\\nSanjaya.\\nHim, filled with such compassion and such grief,\\nWith eyes tear-dimmed, despondent, in stern words\\nThe Driver, Madhusudan, thus addressed:\\n\\nKrishna.\\nHow hath this weakness taken thee? Whence springs\\nThe inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave,\\nBarring the path of virtue? Nay, Arjun!\\nForbid thyself to feebleness! it mars\\nThy warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit!\\nWake! Be thyself! Arise, Scourge of thy Foes!\\n\\nArjuna.\\nHow can I, in the battle, shoot with shafts\\nOn Bhishma, or on Drona-O thou Chief!--\\nBoth worshipful, both honourable men?\\n\\nBetter to live on beggar\\'s bread\\nWith those we love alive,\\nThan taste their blood in rich feasts spread,\\nAnd guiltily survive!\\nAh! were it worse-who knows?--to be\\nVictor or vanquished here,\\nWhen those confront us angrily\\nWhose death leaves living drear?\\nIn pity lost, by doubtings tossed,\\nMy thoughts-distracted-turn\\nTo Thee, the Guide I reverence most,\\nThat I may counsel learn:\\nI know not what would heal the grief\\nBurned into soul and sense,\\nIf I were earth\\'s unchallenged chief--\\nA god--and these gone thence!\\n\\nSanjaya.\\nSo spake Arjuna to the Lord of Hearts,\\nAnd sighing,\"I will not fight!\" held silence then.\\nTo whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata! )\\nWhile the Prince wept despairing \\'twixt those hosts,\\nKrishna made answer in divinest verse:\\n\\nKrishna.\\nThou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak\\'st\\nWords lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart\\nMourn not for those that live, nor those that die.\\nNor I, nor thou, nor any one of these,\\nEver was not, nor ever will not be,\\nFor ever and for ever afterwards.\\nAll, that doth live, lives always! To man\\'s frame\\nAs there come infancy and youth and age,\\nSo come there raisings-up and layings-down\\nOf other and of other life-abodes,\\nWhich the wise know, and fear not. This that irks--\\nThy sense-life, thrilling to the elements--\\nBringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys,\\n\\'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince!\\nAs the wise bear. The soul which is not moved,\\nThe soul that with a strong and constant calm\\nTakes sorrow and takes joy indifferently,\\nLives in the life undying! That which is\\nCan never cease to be; that which is not\\nWill not exist. To see this truth of both\\nIs theirs who part essence from accident,\\nSubstance from shadow. Indestructible,\\nLearn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all;\\nIt cannot anywhere, by any means,\\nBe anywise diminished, stayed, or changed.\\nBut for these fleeting frames which it informs\\nWith spirit deathless, endless, infinite,\\nThey perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight!\\nHe who shall say, \"Lo! I have slain a man!\"\\nHe who shall think, \"Lo! I am slain!\" those both\\nKnow naught! Life cannot slay. Life is not slain!\\nNever the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never;\\nNever was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams!\\nBirthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever;\\nDeath hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it seems!\\n\\nWho knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained,\\nImmortal, indestructible,--shall such\\nSay, \"I have killed a man, or caused to kill?\"\\n\\nNay, but as when one layeth\\nHis worn-out robes away,\\nAnd taking new ones, sayeth,\\n\"These will I wear to-day!\"\\nSo putteth by the spirit\\nLightly its garb of flesh,\\nAnd passeth to inherit\\nA residence afresh.\\n\\nI say to thee weapons reach not the Life;\\nFlame burns it not, waters cannot o\\'erwhelm,\\nNor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable,\\nUnentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched,\\nImmortal, all-arriving, stable, sure,\\nInvisible, ineffable, by word\\nAnd thought uncompassed, ever all itself,\\nThus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,--\\nKnowing it so,--grieve when thou shouldst not grieve?\\nHow, if thou hearest that the man new-dead\\nIs, like the man new-born, still living man--\\nOne same, existent Spirit--wilt thou weep?\\nThe end of birth is death; the end of death\\nIs birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou,\\nChief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls\\nWhich could not otherwise befall? The birth\\nOf living things comes unperceived; the death\\nComes unperceived; between them, beings perceive:\\nWhat is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince?\\n\\nWonderful, wistful, to contemplate!\\nDifficult, doubtful, to speak upon!\\nStrange and great for tongue to relate,\\nMystical hearing for every one!\\nNor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is,\\nWhen seeing, and saying, and hearing are done!\\n\\nThis Life within all living things, my Prince!\\nHides beyond harm; scorn thou to suffer, then,\\nFor that which cannot suffer. Do thy part!\\nBe mindful of thy name, and tremble not!\\nNought better can betide a martial soul\\nThan lawful war; happy the warrior\\nTo whom comes joy of battle--comes, as now,\\nGlorious and fair, unsought; opening for him\\nA gateway unto Heav\\'n. But, if thou shunn\\'st\\nThis honourable field--a Kshattriya--\\nIf, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd\\'st\\nDuty and task go by--that shall be sin!\\nAnd those to come shall speak thee infamy\\nFrom age to age; but infamy is worse\\nFor men of noble blood to bear than death!\\nThe chiefs upon their battle-chariots\\nWill deem \\'twas fear that drove thee from the fray.\\nOf those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn\\nThou must abide, while all thine enemies\\nWill scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock\\nThe valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall\\nMore grievously than this? Either--being killed--\\nThou wilt win Swarga\\'s safety, or--alive\\nAnd victor--thou wilt reign an earthly king.\\nTherefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace\\nThine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet--\\nAs things alike to thee--pleasure or pain,\\nProfit or ruin, victory or defeat:\\nSo minded, gird thee to the fight, for so\\nThou shalt not sin!\\n\\nThus far I speak to thee\\nAs from the \"Sankhya\"--unspiritually--\\nHear now the deeper teaching of the Yog,\\nWhich holding, understanding, thou shalt burst\\nThy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds.\\nHere shall no end be hindered, no hope marred,\\nNo loss be feared: faith--yea, a little faith--\\nShall save thee from the anguish of thy dread.\\nHere, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule--\\nOne steadfast rule--while shifting souls have laws\\nMany and hard. Specious, but wrongful deem\\nThe speech of those ill-taught ones who extol\\nThe letter of their Vedas, saying, \"This\\nIs all we have, or need;\" being weak at heart\\nWith wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes--they say--\\nAs \"fruit of good deeds done;\" promising men\\nMuch profit in new births for works of faith;\\nIn various rites abounding; following whereon\\nLarge merit shall accrue towards wealth and power;\\nAlbeit, who wealth and power do most desire\\nLeast fixity of soul have such, least hold\\nOn heavenly meditation. Much these teach,\\nFrom Veds, concerning the \"three qualities;\"\\nBut thou, be free of the \"three qualities,\"\\nFree of the \"pairs of opposites,\"[FN#2] and free\\nFrom that sad righteousness which calculates;\\nSelf-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied![FN#3]\\nLook! like as when a tank pours water forth\\nTo suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw\\nText for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.\\nBut thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward\\nOf doing right in right! Let right deeds be\\nThy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.\\nAnd live in action! Labour! Make thine acts\\nThy piety, casting all self aside,\\nContemning gain and merit; equable\\nIn good or evil: equability\\nIs Yog, is piety!\\n\\nYet, the right act\\nIs less, far less, than the right-thinking mind.\\nSeek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven!\\nScorn them that follow virtue for her gifts!\\nThe mind of pure devotion--even here--\\nCasts equally aside good deeds and bad,\\nPassing above them. Unto pure devotion\\nDevote thyself: with perfect meditation\\nComes perfect act, and the right-hearted rise--\\nMore certainly because they seek no gain--\\nForth from the bands of body, step by step,\\nTo highest seats of bliss. When thy firm soul\\nHath shaken off those tangled oracles\\nWhich ignorantly guide, then shall it soar\\nTo high neglect of what\\'s denied or said,\\nThis way or that way, in doctrinal writ.\\nTroubled no longer by the priestly lore,\\nSafe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent\\nOn meditation. This is Yog--and Peace!\\n\\nArjuna.\\nWhat is his mark who hath that steadfast heart,\\nConfirmed in holy meditation? How\\nKnow we his speech, Kesava? Sits he, moves he\\nLike other men?\\n\\nKrishna.\\nWhen one, O Pritha\\'s Son!\\nAbandoning desires which shake the mind--\\nFinds in his soul full comfort for his soul,\\nHe hath attained the Yog--that man is such!\\nIn sorrows not dejected, and in joys\\nNot overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress\\nOf passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms\\nOf lofty contemplation;--such an one\\nIs Muni, is the Sage, the true Recluse!\\nHe who to none and nowhere overbound\\nBy ties of flesh, takes evil things and good\\nNeither desponding nor exulting, such\\nBears wisdom\\'s plainest mark! He who shall draw\\nAs the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe\\nUnder its shield, his five frail senses back\\nUnder the spirit\\'s buckler from the world\\nWhich else assails them, such an one, my Prince!\\nHath wisdom\\'s mark! Things that solicit sense\\nHold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes,\\nThe appetites of him who lives beyond\\nDepart,--aroused no more. Yet may it chance,\\nO Son of Kunti! that a governed mind\\nShall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest\\nStrong self-control by the roots. Let him regain\\nHis kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit\\nOn Me intent. That man alone is wise\\nWho keeps the mastery of himself! If one\\nPonders on objects of the sense, there springs\\nAttraction; from attraction grows desire,\\nDesire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds\\nRecklessness; then the memory--all betrayed--\\nLets noble purpose go, and saps the mind,\\nTill purpose, mind, and man are all undone.\\nBut, if one deals with objects of the sense\\nNot loving and not hating, making them\\nServe his free soul, which rests serenely lord,\\nLo! such a man comes to tranquillity;\\nAnd out of that tranquillity shall rise\\nThe end and healing of his earthly pains,\\nSince the will governed sets the soul at peace.\\nThe soul of the ungoverned is not his,\\nNor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked,\\nHow grows serenity? and, wanting that,\\nWhence shall he hope for happiness?\\n\\nThe mind\\nThat gives itself to follow shows of sense\\nSeeth its helm of wisdom rent away,\\nAnd, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives\\nTo wreck and death. Only with him, great Prince!\\nWhose senses are not swayed by things of sense--\\nOnly with him who holds his mastery,\\nShows wisdom perfect. What is midnight-gloom\\nTo unenlightened souls shines wakeful day\\nTo his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day\\nIs known for night, thick night of ignorance,\\nTo his true-seeing eyes. Such is the Saint!\\n\\nAnd like the ocean, day by day receiving\\nFloods from all lands, which never overflows\\nIts boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving,\\nFed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;--\\n\\nSo is the perfect one! to his soul\\'s ocean\\nThe world of sense pours streams of witchery;\\nThey leave him as they find, without commotion,\\nTaking their tribute, but remaining sea.\\n\\nYea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh\\nLives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free\\nFrom pride, from passion, from the sin of \"Self,\"\\nToucheth tranquillity! O Pritha\\'s Son!\\nThat is the state of Brahm! There rests no dread\\nWhen that last step is reached! Live where he will,\\nDie when he may, such passeth from all \\'plaining,\\nTo blest Nirvana, with the Gods, attaining.\\n\\nHERE ENDETH  II. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,\\nEntitled \"Sankhya-Yog,\"\\nOr \"The Book of Doctrines.\"\\n\\n III\\n\\nArjuna.\\nThou whom all mortals praise, Janardana!\\nIf meditation be a nobler thing\\nThan action, wherefore, then, great Kesava!\\nDost thou impel me to this dreadful fight?\\nNow am I by thy doubtful speech disturbed!\\nTell me one thing, and tell me certainly;\\nBy what road shall I find the better end?\\n\\nKrishna.\\nI told thee, blameless Lord! there be two paths\\nShown to this world; two schools of wisdom.\\n\\nFirst\\nThe Sankhya\\'s, which doth save in way of works\\nPrescribed[FN#4] by reason; next, the Yog, which bids\\nAttain by meditation, spiritually:\\nYet these are one! No man shall \\'scape from act\\nBy shunning action; nay, and none shall come\\nBy mere renouncements unto perfectness.\\nNay, and no jot of time, at any time,\\nRests any actionless; his nature\\'s law\\nCompels him, even unwilling, into act;\\n[For thought is act in fancy]. He who sits\\nSuppressing all the instruments of flesh,\\nYet in his idle heart thinking on them,\\nPlays the inept and guilty hypocrite:\\nBut he who, with strong body serving mind,\\nGives up his mortal powers to worthy work,\\nNot seeking gain, Arjuna! such an one\\nIs honourable. Do thine allotted task!\\nWork is more excellent than idleness;\\nThe body\\'s life proceeds not, lacking work.\\nThere is a task of holiness to do,\\nUnlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not\\nThe faithful soul; such earthly duty do\\nFree from desire, and thou shalt well perform\\nThy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati--\\nIn the beginning, when all men were made,\\nAnd, with mankind, the sacrifice-- \"Do this!\\nWork! sacrifice! Increase and multiply\\nWith sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk,\\nYour \\'Cow of Plenty,\\' giving back her milk\\nOf all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;\\nThe gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye crave\\nThe gods will grant to Labour, when it pays\\nTithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats\\nFruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven\\nNo gift of toil, that thief steals from his world.\"\\n\\nWho eat of food after their sacrifice\\nAre quit of fault, but they that spread a feast\\nAll for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin.\\nBy food the living live; food comes of rain,\\nAnd rain comes by the pious sacrifice,\\nAnd sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil;\\nThus action is of Brahma, who is One,\\nThe Only, All-pervading; at all times\\nPresent in sacrifice. He that abstains\\nTo help the rolling wheels of this great world,\\nGlutting his idle sense, lives a lost life,\\nShameful and vain. Existing for himself,\\nSelf-concentrated, serving self alone,\\nNo part hath he in aught; nothing achieved,\\nNought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope\\nOf help for all the living things of earth\\nDepends from him.[FN#5] Therefore, thy task prescribed\\nWith spirit unattached gladly perform,\\nSince in performance of plain duty man\\nMounts to his highest bliss. By works alone\\nJanak and ancient saints reached blessedness!\\nMoreover, for the upholding of thy kind,\\nAction thou should\\'st embrace. What the wise choose\\nThe unwise people take; what best men do\\nThe multitude will follow. Look on me,\\nThou Son of Pritha! in the three wide worlds\\nI am not bound to any toil, no height\\nAwaits to scale, no gift remains to gain,\\nYet I act here! and, if I acted not--\\nEarnest and watchful--those that look to me\\nFor guidance, sinking back to sloth again\\nBecause I slumbered, would decline from good,\\nAnd I should break earth\\'s order and commit\\nHer offspring unto ruin, Bharata!\\nEven as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense,\\nSo let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set\\nTo bring the world deliverance, and its bliss;\\nNot sowing in those simple, busy hearts\\nSeed of despair. Yea! let each play his part\\nIn all he finds to do, with unyoked soul.\\nAll things are everywhere by Nature wrought\\nIn interaction of the qualities.\\nThe fool, cheated by self, thinks, \"This I did\"\\nAnd \"That I wrought; \"but--ah, thou strong-armed Prince!--\\nA better-lessoned mind, knowing the play\\nOf visible things within the world of sense,\\nAnd how the qualities must qualify,\\nStandeth aloof even from his acts.

They who shall keep\\nMy ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts,\\nHave quittance from all issue of their acts;\\nBut those who disregard My ordinance,\\nThinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss,\\nConfused and foolish. \\'Sooth, the instructed one\\nDoth of his kind, following what fits him most:\\nAnd lower creatures of their kind; in vain\\nContending \\'gainst the law. Needs must it be\\nThe objects of the sense will stir the sense\\nTo like and dislike, yet th\\' enlightened man\\nYields not to these, knowing them enemies.\\nFinally, this is better, that one do\\nHis own task as he may, even though he fail,\\nThan take tasks not his own, though they seem good.\\nTo die performing duty is no ill;\\nBut who seeks other roads shall wander still.\\n\\nArjuna.\\nYet tell me, Teacher! by what force doth man\\nGo to his ill, unwilling; as if one\\nPushed him that evil path?\\n\\nKrishna.\\nKama it is!\\nPassion it is! born of the Darknesses,\\nWhich pusheth him.

Constrain th\\' entangled sense!\\nResist the false, soft sinfulness which saps\\nKnowledge and judgment! Yea, the world is strong,\\nBut what discerns it stronger, and the mind\\nStrongest; and high o\\'er all the ruling Soul.\\nWherefore, perceiving Him who reigns supreme,\\nPut forth full force of Soul in thy own soul!\\nFight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear Hero! slay\\nWhat haunts thee in fond shapes, and would betray!\\n\\nHERE ENDETH  III.

(18:49–50) These”\\n― Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, The Bhagavad Gita\\n6 likesLike\\n“For when the mind becomes bound to a passion of the wandering senses, this passion carries away man\\'s wisdom, even as the wind drives a vessel on the waves.”\\n― Juan Mascaró, The Bhagavad Gita\\ntags: awareness, enlightenment, wisdom5 likesLike\\n“whoever remembers him at the time of death will enter madbhavam, “my being.” If Arjuna can remember Krishna in the hour of death, he will be united with Krishna and enter into immortality.”\\n― Ved Vyasa, The Bhagavad Gita\\n5 likesLike\\n“Knowledge is better than practice;\\nmeditation is better\\nthan knowledge; and best of all\\nis surrender, which soon brings peace.”\\n― Stephen Mitchell, The Bhagavad Gita\\n5 likesLike\\n“The sattvic perform sacrifices with their entire mind fixed on the purpose of the sacrifice. Without thought of reward, they follow the teachings of the scriptures. 12 The rajasic perform sacrifices for the sake of show and the good it will bring them. 13 The tamasic perform sacrifices ignoring both the letter and the spirit. They omit the proper prayers, the proper offerings, the proper food, and the proper faith.”\\n― Ved Vyasa, The Bhagavad Gita\\n5 likesLike\\n“18 The wise see that there is action in the midst of inaction and inaction in the midst of action. Their consciousness is unified, and every act is done with complete awareness.”\\n― Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, The Bhagavad Gita\\n4 likesLike\\n“Krishna assures Arjuna that his basic nature is not subject to time and death; yet he reminds him that he cannot realize this truth if he cannot see beyond the dualities of life: pleasure and pain, success and failure, even heat and cold. The Gita does not teach a spirituality aimed at an enjoyable life in the hereafter, nor does it teach a way to enhance power in this life or the next. It teaches a basic detachment from pleasure and pain, as this chapter says more than once. Only in this way can an individual rise above the conditioning of life’s dualities and identify with the Atman, the immortal Self. Also,”\\n― Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, The Bhagavad Gita\\n4 likesLike\\n“The image of God is found essentially and personally in all mankind. Each possesses it whole, entire and undivided, and all together not more than one alone. In this way we are all one, intimately united in our eternal image, which is the image of God and the source in us of all our life.”\\n― Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, The Bhagavad Gita\\n4 likesLike\\n“Those who are established in wisdom (sthita-prajna) live in continuous, unbroken awareness that they are not the perishable body but the Atman. Further, they see the same Self in everyone, for the Atman is universally present in all. Such a one, Krishna says, does not identify with personal desires. These desires are on the surface of personality, and the Self is its very core. The Self-realized man or woman is not motivated by personal desires – in other words, by any desire for kama, personal satisfaction.”\\n― Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, The Bhagavad Gita\\n4 likesLike\\n“Be fearless and pure; never waver in your determination or your dedication to the spiritual life. Give freely. Be self-controlled, sincere, truthful, loving, and full of the desire to serve. Realize the truth of the scriptures; learn to be detached and to take joy in renunciation. 2 Do not get angry or harm any living creature, but be compassionate and gentle; show good will to all. 3 Cultivate vigor, patience, will, purity; avoid malice and pride.”\\n― Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, The Bhagavad Gita\\n4 likesLike\\n“renunciation of selfishness in thought, word, and action”\\n― Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, The Bhagavad Gita\\n4 likesLike\\n“Ramakrishna says, “One who has merely heard of fire has ajnana, ignorance. One who has seen fire has jnana. But one who has actually built a fire and cooked on it has vijnana.” In”\\n― Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, The Bhagavad Gita\\n'"
